Decided to also add older papers - their quality will therefore differ from the newer ones...

Note about the projects: 
Over a period of 4 weeks (3 weeks for Semester 5), research is conducted by student groups around a specific topic. Semester 4 was a project designed and led by 2 friends and me.
The contribution list can be found in the appendix. 

Note about the lab reports:
The data is collected in a 1 day session, the lab report is due a week after that.
